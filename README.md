### Hello, 你好, Halo, Hola!

I’ve mocked up website designs, prototyped VR games, and learned to be an avid functional programmer beyond my professional web development career. I’m an engineer and above all else, an unapologetically user-centric designer.

Currently in Boston. Making cool stuff at [Upstatement](www.upstatement.com). Learning (or really relearning) Spanish on Duolingo. And still in quarantine...
