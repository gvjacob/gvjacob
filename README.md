**Hello, 你好, Halo!**

I build accessible products for the web. My best work comes when I collaborate with meaningful brands, embrace experimentation, and [use Neovim (btw)](https://x.com/neovim_btw). Full time, I lead technical strategy, improve our accessibilty practice, and carve out the prettiest websites in our corner of the web at [Upstatement](https://upstatement.com/), a global digital product studio. I am lucky to have worked with brands like [Harvard](https://www.hbs.edu/), [Brené Brown](https://brenebrown.com/), [The Engine](https://engine.xyz/), [Beacon](https://beaconcapital.com/), and [GoNoodle](https://supernoodle.gonoodle.com/).
