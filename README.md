### Hello, 你好, Halo, Hola!

Lucky to have built a life-saving app, democratized technology skills, and developed some really pretty websites. I'm an engineer, and above all else, an unapologetically user-centric designer.

Currently in Boston. Making cool stuff at [Upstatement](www.upstatement.com). Learning (or really relearning) Spanish on Duolingo. And still in quarantine...
